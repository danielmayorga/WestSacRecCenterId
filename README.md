# West Sacramento Rec Center Login Barcode. 

## What's the Project

A simple barcode generator for people to use to enter the West Sacramento Rec Center.

I just want to simplify the process with the fewest amount of button presses and confusion while getting rid of KeyRing! :p 

## Why does this exists

Right now West Sacramento Recreational Center is using the KeyRing App. 
I hate it. Here's why:

- It's confusing to create a Barcode for the gym membership. I can't expect my parents to figure it out
- The UI is overly complex since it has to support other cards. I only want 1 app for my gym membership barcode
- Keyring failed to generate the barcode during 1 session.

What have I done in the meantime?

I've taken a screenshot of the barcode and added it to my photo's library under they "Gym" Album.

Why do I not like this solution.
I have to stumble with 4 button clicks: 
Open Photos -> Click on Albums -> Click on Gym Album -> Click on the Image I want.
